    "# Context - Machine learning for material development\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accelerate the development of material design, the ability of machine learning as a tool is looked into. We want to test whether machine learning can predict new functional materials in relevant fields. In this case, we train the machine learning algorithm to judge whether a \"compound\" can be a prospective thermoelectric material. Thermoelectric materials are those materials that can generate electricity due to a temperature gradient across it. \"Band gap\" is a property used here to determine the ability of a material to be thermo-electric. The band-gap is influenced by input descriptors.  The details of dataset are given below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three main components needed to do this task are :  descriptors (features), training data and a machine learning algorithm.â€‹\n",
    "\n",
    "## Descriptors : \n",
    "These are properties of material that can be used to compare one compound to another compound. In this case, the descriptors are information about the chemical elements that form the new compound. We have downloaded information for about 70000 compounds. A compound is made of chemical elements. For example, water is a compound with formulae H2O. In machine learning language, descriptors are input feature data to be used by the machine learning algorithm. Thus, Descriptors are sort of prior chemical knowledge thats helps the machine learning model to look \"where\" the pattern is in the periodic table, thus allowing the algorithm to determine \"what\" the pattern is. The descriptors are : \n",
