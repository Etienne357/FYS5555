# Machine learning analysis

Machine learning tools to be used for educational purposes

This section is still under construction. An example of a full analysis on different physics scenarios (signal vs. background) will be available soon.

- The program has been written in a generic way possible so that you can check the performance of different ML algorithms: logistic regression, boosted decision tree (BDT), random forest and support vector machine (SVM). You can also implement your own algorithm.
- You will find details in the notebook which explain the purpose of each block of code.
- The folder "GeiloWinterSchool2018" is a good place to learn about machine learning and the different algorithms.
- Machine learning analysis on the Higgs data will be added soon.
