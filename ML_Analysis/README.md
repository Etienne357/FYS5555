# Machine learning analysis

This part is still under construction. A simple analysis has been written for the classification of two backgrounds and you will see that the machine learning methods actually work. The full analysis on different physics scenarios (signal vs. background) will be available soon.

- The program has been written in a generic way possible so that you can check the performance of different ML algorithms: logistic regression, boosted decision tree (BDT), random forest and support vector machine (SVM). You can also implement your own algorithm.
- You will find details in the notebook which explain the purpose of each block of code.
- The folder "GeiloWinterSchool2018" is a good place to learn about machine learning and the different algorithms.
- Machine learning analysis on the Higgs data can be found in
