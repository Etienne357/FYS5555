# FYS5555

This git page has been created to gather all the "hands-on" material of the course Research-based particle physics (FYS5555).

To copy all the material on your PC, in the terminal do `git clone https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555.git`

- CompHEP is a software package and event generator used to compute cross-sections. Follow the instructions on the following readme file for its installation: https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555/blob/master/CompHEP/README.md.
- You will need ROOT to do any analysis so it's better to install it once and for all. The best and tested way to install ROOT (which works with C++ and Python3) is via Anaconda which also contains all the machine learning packages; forget about other complicated ways to install ROOT. Follow the instructions given here: https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555/blob/master/Anaconda_setup/README.md
- An example dilepton (cut-and-count) analysis on the open data has been provided in the folder "Conventional_Analysis". This can be used as a skeleton to plot histograms and for further analyses. Instructions are found in https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555/blob/master/Conventional_Analysis/README.md
- The statistical analysis on cross-section limits can be found in the "Statistics" folder. Instructions are found in https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555/blob/master/Statistics/README.md.
- The SUSYPheno folder contains all the materials for the Supersymmetry part of the course. The instructions can be found in https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555/blob/master/SUSYPheno/README.md. 
- The machine learning analysis is found in the folder "ML_analysis". This section is still work in progress and will be finalized soon.
