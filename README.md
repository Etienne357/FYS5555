# FYS5555

This git page has been created to gather all the "hands-on" material of the course Research-based particle physics (FYS5555). 

- CompHEP is a software package and event generator used to compute cross-sections. Follow the instructions on the following readme file for its installation: https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555/blob/master/CompHEP/README.md.
- An example dilepton (cut-and-count) analysis on the open data has been provided in the folder "Conventional_Analysis". This can be used as a skeleton to plot histograms and for further analyses. Instructions are found in https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555/tree/master/Conventional_Analysis/README.md.
- The statistical analysis on cross-section limits can be found in the "Statistics" folder. Instructions are found in https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555/tree/master/Statistics/README.md.
- The SUSYPheno folder contains all the materials on  Supersymmetry. The instructions can be found in https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555/tree/master/SUSYPheno/README.md.
- The machine learning analysis is found in the folder "ML_analysis". This section is still under construction and will be finalized soon. Instructions on how to set up Anaconda with the required packages are found in https://github.com/Etienne357/FYS5555/blob/master/ML_Analysis/README.md.
