# Conventional (cut-and-count) analysis 

This part has been prepared by Even HÃ¥land and focuses on data analysis using cuts on the various variables.

 - The various data analysis concepts are explained in the "Presentation" folder.
 - In the "Notebooks" folder, you will find an example analysis with two leptons as final state (dilepton analysis).  
 - An up-to-date code example that runs on the new 13 TeV ATLAS Open Data release is found under "CodeExample"
